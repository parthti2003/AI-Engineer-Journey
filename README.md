# 🧠 AI Engineer Journey — Parth Tiwari

Welcome to the **real-time evolution** of a self-taught, product-focused AI Engineer who’s turning deep learning into real-world results — one project, one problem, one line of code at a time.

Daily AI engineer grind: notes, projects, DSA, and real results.

This repo documents my transformation into an AI Engineer who can:
- Build intelligent systems end-to-end
- Craft products that think, talk, and solve real pain
- Go deep into NLP, GenAI, and scalable AI design
- Thrive under pressure, ship consistently, and adapt fast

## 👝 The Mission

I’m not here to "learn AI" — I’m here to **master the craft of building**.  
This repo is my vault — it contains everything I’m doing to build mastery from the ground up:

- 🐍 Python → Proficiency & mini tools
- ♻ DSA → Daily drills for problem-solving clarity
- 🤖 ML + DL → Concept → Code → Projects
- 📚 NLP + GenAI → Real tools using Transformers, RAG, Chat UIs
- 🧹 System Thinking → From models to products to user experience

## 🧠 Mindset

I believe in **earning reputation through proof**, not words.  
This repo is a reflection of:
- 🥇 Discipline over hype  
- 📈 Progress over perfection  
- 🧱 Products over promises  

> It’s not just a resume. It’s evidence.

## 💼 Want to Collaborate or Hire?

If you’re looking for someone who:
- Doesn’t just finish courses, but ships tools
- Can think in systems, speak in models, and write in code
- Is not waiting to be told what to build — but already building

Let’s talk.
